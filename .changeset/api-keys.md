API keys for scripts, other apps and AI assistants. With `apiKeys: true`, **Settings → API keys** in the admin creates keys that are shown once and stored as a hash. A key acts as its owner, limited to the collections, globals and actions it lists (read, create or upload, update, delete, publish); it never reaches users or other keys. Send it as `Authorization: Bearer ecms_…`. Bad, expired or revoked keys get `401 Invalid or expired API key`. Also `cms.createApiKey()` in the Local API and `user.apiKey` in access rules and hooks.
