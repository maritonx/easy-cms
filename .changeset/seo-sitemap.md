SEO for the whole site, not just each page.

- **Sitemap:** `sitemap(cms)` (the shape of Next.js `app/sitemap.ts`) and `sitemapXml(cms)` list the pages visitors can see: published documents with an address from `generateURL`, with `lastmod` and hreflang links to every locale. Over 50,000 addresses become a sitemap index.
- **robots.txt:** `robotsTxt({ config })` keeps crawlers out of the admin and the API (not uploaded files) and points them to the sitemap; `disallowAll` for staging.
- **Hide from search engines:** a new `meta.noindex` checkbox adds `robots: noindex` and leaves the page out of the sitemap. It is a new column: run `easy-cms migrate:create` after updating.
- **seoMeta:** `url: (doc, locale) => …` adds hreflang links and `x-default`; `locale` adds `og:locale`; `type: 'article'` adds the published and modified times and author. It also returns `jsonLd` (BlogPosting or WebPage) and `head` for Nuxt's `useHead()`. `siteJsonLd()` makes Organization and WebSite data, and `jsonLdScript()` renders JSON-LD safely in a `<script>`.
- **Root endpoints:** `endpoints` accept `root: true` to serve a path from the site's root, e.g. `/robots.txt`. The standalone server (`easy-cms serve`) serves them, so it has `/sitemap.xml` and `/robots.txt` with the SEO plugin; Nuxt and Next.js apps add the routes themselves. `createRootEndpointHandler(cms)` is exported for other servers.
