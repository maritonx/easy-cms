Standalone mode: `easy-cms serve` runs the admin and REST API as their own server (with `--watch` for development and `/healthz`), so Vite, React, Vue or static frontends can use Easy CMS as a backend. `create-easy-cms` sets one up in a new or empty directory, or with `--standalone`. The REST API supports CORS through the new `cors` config option; `createStandaloneHandler` is exported for Bun, Deno or Hono servers.
