Version history: `versions: true` (or `{ max }`) on a collection or global keeps a version of every save, with history and restore in the Local API (`findVersions`, `findVersion`, `restoreVersion`), REST and a History panel in the admin. With `drafts`, a draft of a published document is kept as a version and the published document stays live until it is published again; `unpublish` and `discardDraft` are new actions. Projects without versions are unchanged and need no migration.
