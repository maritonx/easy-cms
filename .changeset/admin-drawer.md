Small collections can open in a drawer: `editIn: 'drawer'` creates and edits documents in a panel over the list (`?edit=<id>` / `?new` in the URL, so back and reload work). Relationship fields get a "Create …" button that opens the same panel and selects the new document, for targets without drafts, versions or preview.
