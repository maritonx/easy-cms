### Patch Changes

- d742afc: Package READMEs: what each package does, how to install it with npm, pnpm, Yarn or Bun, a short example and links to its guide.

## 0.22.0

### Minor Changes

- 63995c6: npm, pnpm, Yarn and Bun.
  
  - `create-easy-cms --pm npm|pnpm|yarn|bun` picks the package manager; without it, the project's `packageManager` field, then its lockfile, then the one you ran it with (`pnpm create easy-cms`, `bun create easy-cms`…).
  - The next steps it prints use that package manager: `pnpm exec easy-cms migrate`, `yarn easy-cms migrate`, `bunx easy-cms migrate`, `bun run dev`.
  - With Yarn 2 or later it writes `.yarnrc.yml` with `nodeLinker: node-modules` (Plug'n'Play isn't supported).
  - When the package manager isn't installed it says how to get it, and prints the install commands.
  - Messages from core and the Nuxt module no longer assume npx.
  - The docs show every command for npm, pnpm, Yarn and Bun, and keep the one you pick.

### Minor Changes

- d626995: Standalone mode: `easy-cms serve` runs the admin and REST API as their own server (with `--watch` for development and `/healthz`), so Vite, React, Vue or static frontends can use Easy CMS as a backend. `create-easy-cms` sets one up in a new or empty directory, or with `--standalone`. The REST API supports CORS through the new `cors` config option; `createStandaloneHandler` is exported for Bun, Deno or Hono servers.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 01f3816: - Next.js builds no longer trace the whole project into the server output: the config lookup and local upload storage mark their runtime paths with `turbopackIgnore`.
  - `create-easy-cms` and the "secret is required" error now say that the secret must be set in the production environment (Nuxt's production server does not read `.env`).

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 312df64: First release of Easy CMS: an embedded, code-first headless CMS for Nuxt and Next.js with an admin UI,
  typed Local API, REST API, SQLite and Postgres adapters, uploads, drafts, hooks and access control.
