# @easy-cms/email-smtp

## 0.30.0

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [f9d5512]
  - @easy-cms/core@0.30.0

## 0.29.0

### Minor Changes

- 5e92063: The dashboard tells admins what needs attention, and what the system is.
  
  - **Needs attention** (admins only, shown only when something is wrong): webhook deliveries that failed in the last 7 days, emails waiting over an hour or failed, scheduled publishing over 10 minutes late (nothing calls `jobs/run`), no `email`, and no `serverURL` in production. Each links to the new Health checks guide.
  - **System** (admins only): the Easy CMS version, database, file storage, email adapter, plugins with their versions, and field types.
  - Both come from the new `GET <api>/admin/status`, for admins only. Easy CMS doesn't check for new versions.
  - **`definePlugin(plugin, { name, version })`** names a plugin for the dashboard; the official plugins name themselves. `EmailAdapter` gets an optional `name` (`smtp`, `console`). Core exports `VERSION`.
  - In development, the admin's HTML is read on each request, so a rebuilt admin shows up without a restart.

### Minor Changes

- b7564cb: Forms and email.
  
  - **Email:** `email` in the config sends email for plugins and your hooks: `smtp()` from the new `@easy-cms/email-smtp` (Gmail, SES, Resend, Mailgun or any SMTP server), `consoleEmail()` for development, or your own adapter. `cms.sendEmail()` queues each email in the database and retries it for about a day if sending fails (`runJobs`); `flushEmails()` waits for them on serverless hosts. Needs a migration for the `email-deliveries` table.
  - **New package `@easy-cms/plugin-form-builder`:** editors build forms in the admin from field blocks (text, long text, email, number, phone, choice, checkbox, date, message), with a confirmation message or redirect and notification emails (`{{name}}`, `{{*}}`, and confirmations to the sender). Submissions are validated on the server, stored without IP addresses and exported as CSV. A honeypot, a minimum time, a rate limit per visitor and optional Cloudflare Turnstile keep bots out. `<easy-form form="contact">` renders a form on any page (the CMS also serves it at `/api/cms/form/element.js`); `getForm()` and `submitForm()` are there for your own components. Needs a migration for the `forms` and `form-submissions` collections.
  - Requests without a session cookie from origins in `cors` now pass the CSRF check, so frontends on other origins can send forms without being trusted with cookies. Endpoints get the client's `ip`.
  - The admin's lists can be narrowed to one related document from the URL (`?f_form=3`).
