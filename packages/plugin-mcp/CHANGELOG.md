## 0.23.0

### Minor Changes

- 0107902: Image galleries: upload fields with several files.
  
  - **`upload` with `hasMany: true`** keeps several files in the order editors arrange them, e.g. a gallery on a post. In the admin editors drop several files at once, pick several from the media library, drag them into order (or use the arrow buttons) and remove them. Reads return the media documents in order; it can be `localized`, and queries like `where: { gallery: { in: [id] } }` work. Needs a migration for the new field.
  - **`mimeTypes`** on upload fields, e.g. `['image/*']`: the media picker offers only those files, and saving refuses others ("must be an image").
  - **`minRows` / `maxRows`** on upload and relationship fields with `hasMany`.
  - An empty list now counts as fewer than `minRows` (arrays and blocks too); drafts may still be incomplete.

### Minor Changes

- e6e4abb: New: `@easy-cms/plugin-mcp`, an MCP server (Streamable HTTP, stateless) at `<api>/mcp` for AI assistants such as Claude, Cursor and VS Code. Assistants connect with an API key and get tools for exactly what it allows: find, get, create, update, delete, publish, schedule and upload for each collection, and read, update and publish for globals. Collections with drafts are always saved as drafts; only the publish tool puts them live. Rich text accepts plain text, and uploads come as base64.
