### Minor Changes

- 281435f: Database backups from the admin.
  
  - **Settings → Backups** (admins): **Back up now**, the list of backups with who made and last downloaded each, **Download** and **Delete**.
  - **`backups: { every, at, keep, dir, storage, sqlite }`** in the config: back up every `day` or `week` at `at` (server time), keep the newest `keep` (7). Without `every`, back up by hand.
  - Each backup is one compressed SQLite file (`<site>-YYYY-MM-DD-HHmm.db.gz`) of the whole database. SQLite copies itself; Postgres is copied into a SQLite file with `backups.sqlite` (`sqlite` from `@easy-cms/db-sqlite`).
  - Stored privately: `backups/` by default (never the uploads folder, never served) or `backups.storage`, e.g. a private S3 bucket. Downloads go through the server, for admins only.
  - Scheduled backups run with scheduled jobs (every minute on a server, or from the `jobs/run` cron); one at a time. The dashboard's "Needs attention" warns when the last scheduled backup failed or none finished in two periods.
  - `easy-cms backup <file>` uses the same engine: it now backs up Postgres too, and compresses a `.gz` name.
  - Adds the internal `database-backups` table: create a migration (`easy-cms migrate:create backups`).

### Minor Changes

- 0107902: Image galleries: upload fields with several files.
  
  - **`upload` with `hasMany: true`** keeps several files in the order editors arrange them, e.g. a gallery on a post. In the admin editors drop several files at once, pick several from the media library, drag them into order (or use the arrow buttons) and remove them. Reads return the media documents in order; it can be `localized`, and queries like `where: { gallery: { in: [id] } }` work. Needs a migration for the new field.
  - **`mimeTypes`** on upload fields, e.g. `['image/*']`: the media picker offers only those files, and saving refuses others ("must be an image").
  - **`minRows` / `maxRows`** on upload and relationship fields with `hasMany`.
  - An empty list now counts as fewer than `minRows` (arrays and blocks too); drafts may still be incomplete.

## 0.21.0

### Minor Changes

- 0e69436: Nested pages.
  
  - **New package `@easy-cms/plugin-nested-docs`:** pages inside pages (About → Team). Each document in the listed collections gets a `parent`, its full `path` (`/about/team`) and its `breadcrumbs`, per language when the slug is localized. When a page gets a new slug or parent, the pages under it are updated too, when it is published; with the redirects plugin their old addresses redirect. A page can't be moved under itself, levels are limited (`maxDepth`), and a page with pages under it can't be deleted (or they move up, with `onDeleteParent: 'orphan'`). `findByPath()`, `getTree()` and `GET /api/cms/tree/:collection` show pages and menus; `npx easy-cms nested:rebuild` works out the paths of pages that existed before. Needs a migration for the new fields.
  - **Relationship `filterOptions`:** which documents a relationship may point to, worked out on the server. The admin's picker offers only those, and saving checks them.
  - **Slug `uniqueWithin`:** slugs unique only among documents with the same value of another field, e.g. `uniqueWithin: 'parent'`.
  - **Tree lists:** `admin: { list: { tree: 'parent' } }` shows a collection's list as a tree; `list.sort` sets the list's default order.
  - **`update(…, { live: true })`:** upkeep of the live version that leaves a pending draft pending and adds no version.
  - **CLI commands from the config:** `commands: [{ name, description, run }]`, e.g. from plugins.
  - **SEO:** `seoMeta({ breadcrumbs })` adds BreadcrumbList JSON-LD.

### Minor Changes

- 6c7eb74: `easy-cms copy --from <config>` copies every document, version, user and global from one database into another, for example from SQLite to Postgres (or back). Ids stay the same, so relationships, history and logins keep working. Both configs must have the same collections and fields, and the target must be empty. Also available as `copyDatabase(source.db, target.db)` from `@easy-cms/core`.

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- cab02f9: `easy-cms backup <file>` copies a SQLite database to a new file while the CMS keeps running (a consistent snapshot through `VACUUM INTO`). Databases expose it as the optional `db.backup(file)`; for Postgres, use `pg_dump`.
- cab02f9: Faster reads on large collections: collections with drafts get an index on `status` (list counts were scanning the whole table; 8× faster at 100,000 documents), and on Postgres, `equals`/`in` inside blocks use JSON containment (about 6× faster). The index changes the schema: run `easy-cms migrate:create` after upgrading.

## 0.9.1

### Patch Changes

- 93202ca: SQLite: writes from separate processes to the same file now wait for each other reliably (libSQL busy timeout, `busyTimeout` option, default 10 s) instead of sometimes failing with "database is locked"; instances in one process share a write queue per file.
- @easy-cms/core@0.9.1

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- ce7f66d: `sort` works on fields in lists inside blocks (`layout.items.title`), using the first value found in block and row order.
- ce7f66d: SQLite: a write waits (up to 10 s) for another process writing to the same file, instead of failing with "database is locked".

### Patch Changes

- @easy-cms/core@0.9.0

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- e032e1c: `where` reaches into lists inside blocks (`layout.items.title`, `layout.tags`, `layout.content.blockType`), and `sort` works on block fields (`-layout.columns`, using the first block that has the field).

### Patch Changes

- e032e1c: SQLite: writes made at the same time wait for each other instead of failing with "database is locked".
- Updated dependencies [e032e1c]
  - @easy-cms/core@0.8.0

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- da85424: `where` can look inside blocks: `layout.blockType`, `layout.heading`, `layout.heading.en`, fields in groups inside blocks, and `layout: { exists }`.
- da85424: Changing `localization.defaultLocale` keeps every locale's values: migrations (and development push) move them between columns. Snapshots now record the locales; migrations created before this release don't, so create one before the first change.

### Patch Changes

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- a76cf49: Blocks field: `{ type: 'blocks', blocks: [{ slug, fields }] }` holds rows of different kinds (`{ id, blockType, ...fields }`), validated, populated and typed as a union, with an admin editor to add, reorder and remove blocks. Inferred types now treat arrays, blocks, groups and hasMany fields as always present.
- a76cf49: Localized arrays and hasMany fields: one list per locale (child tables get a `_locale` column; existing rows become the default locale's), queryable as `tags.en`. Reads with `locale: 'all'` no longer turn localized relationships into `null`.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- df8b783: Localization: `localization: { locales, defaultLocale }` in the config and `localized: true` on fields store one value per locale (one column per locale; the default locale keeps the existing column, so turning it on keeps data). Reads and writes take `locale` (or `'all'`) and `fallbackLocale`, REST takes `?locale=` and `?fallback-locale=`; queries, sorting, slugs and unique values work per locale. The admin gets a content language switcher.
