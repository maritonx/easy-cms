## 0.26.0

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [bcf3c0c]
  - @easy-cms/core@0.26.0

## 0.25.0

### Minor Changes

- 434599a: Typed plugin fields.
  
  - **`definePlugin<T>(plugin)`** tells the inferred document types what a plugin adds: fields on collections and globals, and whole collections. `CollectionDocument`, `cms.find()` and the rest then know them, with no command to run.
  - **The official plugins declare theirs:** `post.meta` (SEO), `page.parent`, `page.path` and `page.breadcrumbs` (nested pages, with the names you give), the `redirects` collection with its `to_<collection>` fields, and the `forms` and `form-submissions` collections.
  - `findByPath()` returns the page typed from your config; `getTree()` and `rebuildNestedDocs()` take your typed `cms`.
  - New types in core: `PluginTypes`, `TypedPlugin`, `DocumentOf` and `SlugOf` for helpers that take an `EasyCMS<C>`.

### Minor Changes

- 0e69436: Nested pages.
  
  - **New package `@easy-cms/plugin-nested-docs`:** pages inside pages (About → Team). Each document in the listed collections gets a `parent`, its full `path` (`/about/team`) and its `breadcrumbs`, per language when the slug is localized. When a page gets a new slug or parent, the pages under it are updated too, when it is published; with the redirects plugin their old addresses redirect. A page can't be moved under itself, levels are limited (`maxDepth`), and a page with pages under it can't be deleted (or they move up, with `onDeleteParent: 'orphan'`). `findByPath()`, `getTree()` and `GET /api/cms/tree/:collection` show pages and menus; `npx easy-cms nested:rebuild` works out the paths of pages that existed before. Needs a migration for the new fields.
  - **Relationship `filterOptions`:** which documents a relationship may point to, worked out on the server. The admin's picker offers only those, and saving checks them.
  - **Slug `uniqueWithin`:** slugs unique only among documents with the same value of another field, e.g. `uniqueWithin: 'parent'`.
  - **Tree lists:** `admin: { list: { tree: 'parent' } }` shows a collection's list as a tree; `list.sort` sets the list's default order.
  - **`update(…, { live: true })`:** upkeep of the live version that leaves a pending draft pending and adds no version.
  - **CLI commands from the config:** `commands: [{ name, description, run }]`, e.g. from plugins.
  - **SEO:** `seoMeta({ breadcrumbs })` adds BreadcrumbList JSON-LD.
