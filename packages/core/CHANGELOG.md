# @easy-cms/core

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- b6f8aa3: Live preview: `preview: ({ doc }) => url` on a collection or global adds a Preview pane to the admin that shows the real page and updates it as you type, without saving. The server builds the preview document like a normal read (`cms.preview`, `POST /:collection/:id/preview`); pages receive it through `useLivePreview` (auto-imported in Nuxt, `@easy-cms/next/live-preview` in Next.js) or `subscribeLivePreview` from `@easy-cms/core/live-preview`.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 8dd12a8: Version history: `versions: true` (or `{ max }`) on a collection or global keeps a version of every save, with history and restore in the Local API (`findVersions`, `findVersion`, `restoreVersion`), REST and a History panel in the admin. With `drafts`, a draft of a published document is kept as a version and the published document stays live until it is published again; `unpublish` and `discardDraft` are new actions. Projects without versions are unchanged and need no migration.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- d626995: Standalone mode: `easy-cms serve` runs the admin and REST API as their own server (with `--watch` for development and `/healthz`), so Vite, React, Vue or static frontends can use Easy CMS as a backend. `create-easy-cms` sets one up in a new or empty directory, or with `--standalone`. The REST API supports CORS through the new `cors` config option; `createStandaloneHandler` is exported for Bun, Deno or Hono servers.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 01f3816: - Next.js builds no longer trace the whole project into the server output: the config lookup and local upload storage mark their runtime paths with `turbopackIgnore`.
  - `create-easy-cms` and the "secret is required" error now say that the secret must be set in the production environment (Nuxt's production server does not read `.env`).

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 312df64: First release of Easy CMS: an embedded, code-first headless CMS for Nuxt and Next.js with an admin UI,
  typed Local API, REST API, SQLite and Postgres adapters, uploads, drafts, hooks and access control.
